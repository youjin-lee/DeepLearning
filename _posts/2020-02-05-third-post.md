<Abstract>
  
  Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used thorughout science and engieering.
  Yet Because linear algebra is a form of contuinous rather than discrete mathematics, many computer scientists have liter experience with it.
  A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understading and working with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms.
  We therefore precede our introduction to deep learning with a focused presentation of the key linear algegra prerequisites.
  
  recommend **Matrix Cookbook**(Petersen and Pedersen,2006).
  
  this chapter completely omits many important linear algebra topics that are not essential for understading deep learning

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

​```python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('Tom')
​```
